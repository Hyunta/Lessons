<h2>HTML</h2>
<p> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/introduction.html#introduction" target ="_blank" title ="html5.2 specification">
  Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating
    <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

<p style ="margin-top:45px;">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
  and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
  of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of
  the document.</p>
<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which
  affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and
  layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML
  and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
   presentational HTML since 1997.[2]</p>
